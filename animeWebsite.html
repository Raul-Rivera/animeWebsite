      <h2>Naruto Shippuden</h2>
      <p>
        The long-running Naruto series has been referred to as one of the “big three” anime because of its wild popularity around the world, and for good reason. It’s full of action-packed fight sequences, hilariously fun moments, and dramatic scenes that pull at your heartstrings. In Naruto Shippuden, the story takes a darker and more serious tone as the characters are now older and face even more daunting challenges from the shadows as well as themselves. The Naruto anime series is known for its memorable characters and relationships, and it continues to be one of the biggest shounen anime ever, even long after it has ended.

      <h2>Bleach</h2>
      <p>
        A teenager becomes a soul reaper. Ok, so it doesn't push the envelope completely- teenagers with superpowers are not exactly the newest idea in the world but there is a reason for that. So far (in my long life) I have only met one guy who didn't want superpowers when he was young- that guy dreamed of being an accountant... Teenagers and superpowers go together like cheese and bacon. “Bleach” takes it to the next level, combining fantasy and wish fulfillment with mythology and original interpretation. The story basically gives you a working model of what could happen after death- a fairly important questions that occasionally keeps people up at night. What more could you want?

      <h2>One Piece</h2>
      <p>
        There’s a reason Eiichiro Oda's One Piece has been going steady since 1999 and spawned all manner of theatrical and TV spinoffs. We just can’t get enough of the wacky, engrossing saga of stretchable pirate captain Monkey D. Luffy and his ongoing quest to become the next Pirate King. The series is endlessly entertaining, but the characters are what keep you hooked over the course of 900 episodes (and counting).

      <h2>My Hero Academia</h2>
      <p>
        Superhero stories are a dime a dozen, but My Hero Academia offers a unique twist on the familiar genre by focusing on Izuku Midoriya, a hero who was born without powers (but is determined to save people regardless) in a world full of folks with abilities. Even after he earns the "quirk" he's always dreamed of, MHA constantly finds ways to challenge Midoriya's traditional hero's journey by offering new twists on well-worn tropes, exploring what it means to be a hero with consistent humor and heart -- not to mention some spectacular action sequences. Between its stunning animation, loveable roster of well-developed supporting characters, and talent for coming up with some of the most ridiculous and unique superpowers ever committed to the screen, My Hero Academia is a breath of fresh air -- frequently silly, often sweet, and consistently surprising.

      <h2>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</h2>
      <p>
          The struggle of most anime is laying out intricate world-building while balancing a cast of memorable characters, iconic moments, and thrilling fights. And that's what makes Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood so special. The framing device for our entry into this sprawling world is one of sympathy. We understand why the Elric brothers would practice forbidden alchemy in an attempt to resurrect their dead mother at the cost of their physical bodies. And yet despite divine intervention slapping them in the face, telling them no, they continue on their quest. And that quest to resurrect their mother paves the way for motivation that guides them through a world of monsters, government conspiracy, and divinity. And despite all this elegance, FMA: Brotherhood also knows when to lay it all bare in unforgettable moments that will leave you standing in front of your TV cheering for the Elric brothers.

      <h2>Death Note</h2>
      <p>
        Death Note is about a high school student in Japan named Light Yagami. He is an intelligent teen that is too smart for his own good; which is why he finds himself bored. When he discovers the death note, dropped intentionally into the human realm by the Shinigami Ryuk, he begins ridding the world of those he deems evil and therefore unworthy of life. Though his intentions are pure at first, his god complex makes him dangerous. His enemy, known as L, is Light's equally matched and intelligent opponent. He makes it his mission to catch Light, who is being referred to worldwide as Kira, translated in English to killer.
